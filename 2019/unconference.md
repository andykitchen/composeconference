# C◦mp◦se :: Unconference and Exchange 2017

A 2-day weekend community exchange that will be taking place on the weekend following the Conference. It is an informal event where you can meet other typed functional programmers, hack on projects, and exchange ideas.

## Schedule

10am - 5pm, Sunday May 21, 2017

## Preparations

**Registration**

The tickets for the Unconference and Exchange portion over the weekend are free. We need you to register for tickets to help us have a headcount and also to provide a guestlist with the building security. [Register now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cmpse-unconference-and-exchange-2017-tickets-33988530610)!

**Before you arrive**

Pick out a couple of projects to work on and familiarize yourself with them, or bring your own project(s) to work on. See the [projects page](
https://wiki.haskell.org/Compose_Unconference_2017) for a list of projects people plan to work on. If you plan to work on your own project, be sure to list it on the projects page and set up a public repository if you don't already have one, so that other people can help hack on your project.

Install an up to date compiler for whichever language you're working on. If you don't already have these installed (or need to install from scratch on the laptop you're bringing).

**Involvement**

Experienced functional programmers, we encourage you to list your open source projects on the [project page](https://wiki.haskell.org/Compose_Unconference_2017).

**During the event**

The `#composeconference` channel is available on IRC for discussion. Wifi will be available on premise (information given onsite), though be sure to bring your laptop charger and possibly an extension cord.
